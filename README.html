<h1>Implementing Linux on the Leon 3 Processor with the Xilinx ML509</h1>

<br>
This guide will help you get a properly configured implementation of the Leon 3 open-source processor onto the Xilinx ML509 FPGA board. The latter part of the guide will describe how to get a linux distribution running on the Leon 3, and how to cross-compile and run your own code.
<p>
This guide assumes your root folder for the project is 'project/'.

<br><br><br>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
This guide assumes you have the following lab configuration:
<ul>
	<li>An x86_64 Linux host machine</li>
	<li>A Xilinx XUPV5-LX110T (aka ML509) FPGA board</li>
	<li>The Xilinx software suite, including ISE and iMPACT</li>
	<li>A USB-JTAG programming cable with which to program and debug the FPGA</li>
	<li>An RS232 (serial) connection with the FGPA board for I/O</li>
</ul>
These are not hard requirements to get the setup running, but you'll have to find your own solutions for where your setup deviates from the listed requirements.

project folder (project/). Next, extract the netlists (grlib-netlists-1.1.0.tar.gz) to
the root of the source code folder (project/grlib-gpl-1.1.0-b4113/). Extract buildroot (leon3-buildroot-2011.02.tar.gz) to project/ . Lastly,
extract the debug tool (grmon-eval-1.1.54.tar.gz) to the root of your project
folder (project/).

<br><br><br>

<h3>Configuring and Implementing the Leon 3 Design</h3>

First, navigate to 'project/grlib-gpl-1.1.0-b4113/designs/leon3-xilinx-ml509'. You can now make changes to the default Leon 3 design by running:
<p><b>

sudo make xconfig
</b><p>
A GUI should pop up and let you make configuration changes to the board:<p>
Navigate to Processor->Integer unit
<ul>
	<li>Enable MUL/DIV instructions</li>
	<li>Enable branch prediction</li>
</ul>

Navigate to Processor->Floating-point unit<br>
<ul>
	<li>Enable FPU</li>
</ul>
Lastly, 'Save and Exit'.<p>


Now that the Leon 3 configuration tool has made the needed changes to the VHDL of the Leon 3 design, we'll use Xilinx ISE to implement it. Run the following command from 'project/grlib-gpl-1.1.0-b4113/designs/leon3-xilinx-ml509':<p>
<i>NOTE: this following command assumes you have the 'ise' binary in your path, by sourcing /opt/Xilinx/&lt;version&gt;/ISE_DS/settings64.sh.
This following command will create an ISE project in the /leon3-xilinx-ml509
directory. This only needs to be run once to create the project.</i><p> 
<b>
make ise-launch
</b><p>

<i>NOTE: any time you make changes to the VHDL design via 'sudo make
xconfig', ISE will automatically reload the changes. Therefore, if you ever
want to change the processor configuration, just modify the config with 'sudo
make xconfig' and then reimplement the design in ISE.</i><p>


Xilinx ISE should launch with the project loaded.
In the process pane on the left, click 'Implement Top Module'.<p>

If the following errors occur during synthesizing:<p><i>
ERROR:Xst:1249 - Missing part name parameter (-p)<br>
ERROR:Xst:425 - Undefined command: -uc</i><p>

Modify project/grlib-gpl-1.1.0-b4113/designs/leon3-xilinx-ml509/leon3mp.xst:<p>

Replace the lines 5-9 causing the errors (shown:)<br>
&nbsp;-uc leon3mp.xcf<br>
-ifmt mixed<br>
-ofn leon3mp<br>
-ofmt NGC<br>
-p xc5vlx110t-1-ff1136<p>

with the correct lines that will parse correctly (shown:)<br>
-ifmt mixed<br>
-ofn leon3mp<br>
-ofmt NGC<br>
-p xc5vlx110t-1-ff1136<br>
-uc leon3mp.xcf<p>

<b>IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS FILE NEEDS TO BE MADE IMMUTABLE</b><br>
ISE will attempt to change or delete/recreate leon3mp.xst every time XST runs.
To keep the file correctly patched, apply the following commands:<p>
<b>
chmod 555 leon3mp.xst<br>
sudo chattr +i leon3mp.xst</b><p>

XST should produce a warning in its console saying that it could not access
leon3mp.xst, but the process will then continue without errors.

Once the design is synthesized and implemented, double click on 'Generate
Programming File' to create the final bitfile.

Once the programming file has been generated, program the FPGA with the
configuration file via Xilinx iMPACT:<p>

<i>NOTE: The FPGA board should be on and connected via usb jtag to the host
machine.</i><p>

To do so, launch impact. Perform a boundary scan, initialize the jtag chain, assign the newly created bitfile in the leon3-xilinx-ml509 directory as the configuration file, and then program the file.


To test your completed setup, navigate to project/grmon-eval/linux. Here, run:<p>
<b>
./grmon-eval -xilusb
</b><p>
This launches the leon3 debug program that communicates to the board via j-tag.

In another terminal, start a serial communications program (minicom is used in this guide). Serial settings:<p>

baud: 38400<br>
bits: 8<br>
Parity: odd, 1 bit<p>

In the debugger, run:<p>
<b>
load ../samples/dhry.exe <br>
run</b><p>

You should see minicom report that the board has run a Dhrystone benchmark.

<br><br><br>

<h3>Configuring and Loading Linux</h3>

The Leon 3 processor is now properly configured. The next step is to generate a linux image. Navigate to 'project/leon3-buildroot-2011.02/'. Run:<p>
<b>
sudo make xconfig</b> (if you have qt installed)<br>
<b>sudo make menuconfig </b>(if you don't)<p>

This is the configuration page for buildroot, which is an automated tool that takes care of cross-compilation as well as packaging the result into a bootable image for our board. This particular distribution of buildroot is specially configured for our Leon 3 processor (and also contains necessary patches needed for the processor). The only thing here we need to change is, under 'system configuration', select 'Generic serial port config'. Make sure to select baud=38400. Later on, feel free to explore the other options to include debugging tools and other libraries. Save the changes and exit. Run:<p>

<b>sudo make</b><p>

Buildroot will now use its included x86_64 to SPARC crosscompiler to build the linux image. This process may fail when downloading and extracting packages if it cannot download them -- if this happens, it should be apparent which one by the terminal output. Just google the name of the missing package and place it in project/leon3-buildroot-2011.02/dl folder. Then, rerun 'sudo make'.<p>

Once the image is built, we need to use a utility included in buildroot that makes the linux image loadable and bootable via the Leon 3 debug tool. To do so: navigate to project/leon3-buildroot-2011.02/board/leon3. Run:<p><b>
sudo ./make_dsu</b><p>
This will create a file 'image.dsu' in project/leon3-buildroot-2011.02/output/images. Copy this file to the project/grmon-eval/linux directory. Now to load and run the image. Navigate to project/grmon-eval/linux. IMPORTANT: Running './grmon-eval -xilusb' as before will FAIL to run, as it will halt on software traps. Make sure to include the '-nb' argument:<p>
<b>
./grmon-eval -xilusb -nb
</b><p>
Now, in the debugger:<p>
<b>
load image.dsu</b><p>

In another terminal, open minicom with the same settings as mentioned before. Back in the debugger:<p
<b>
run
</b><p>

In minicom, you should be able to interact with the linux environment. Login with username 'root', no password.

<br><br><br>

<h3>Cross-compiling User Code and Loading User Files</h3>

Read project/leon3-buildroot-2011.02/docs/buildroot.html for information on how to use the cross-compiler to generate your own C programs for the Leon 3. Once you have compiled your code successfully, place the executable in project/leon3-buildroot-2011.02/output/target/root (or anywhere in the target filesystem). Then, remake the linux image and rerun make_dsu. Booting from this new image will include your files.
